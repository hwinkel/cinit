Just a small hint-file for me to see how cinit works:

   - cinit starts
      * cinit executes either init or a profile
         - the dependency-tree begins

   - now cinit begins to try to execute the dependencies
      * first the needs (if those fail, wants are never called)
         - fork() for every dependency?
