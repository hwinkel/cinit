What todo with circular dependencies?
   a needs b
   b needs a

   - try to start them?
      a wants b, so a service starter for b starts
      service starter for b sees that a is needed
      service starter for b sees that a is already being started
      service starter for b begins to execute b
      service a waits for b?
