- finish cmd in general, perhaps only including one command.
- begin to write documentation about client functions
- cleanup communication:
   put parts of comm.h into cinit.h => global exposure
   or define new structure in cinit.h?
- Fix this problem:
[18:51] denkbrett:src# LANG=C cp cinit /sbin/cinit 
cp: cannot create regular file `/sbin/cinit': Text file busy


Done:
- cleanup ipc:
   merge cinit_ipc_logon() and cinit_ipc_connect()?
   => already done!
