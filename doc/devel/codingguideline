This document describes the coding style used in cinit.


Indent
------
Indent the code by 3 spaces for each level.


Unsorted
---------
Linebreaks:


if(...) {

} else {
}


do {
} while();

no spaces
   - within braces and code "(!test)", 
   - before braces "if(code)"

spaces
   - after braces "if(test) return 0;"
   - spaces before and after '=' (a = b);

curly braces:
   functions:
      int func(int params)
      {
         body
      }

comments:
   where necessery, do not state the obvious in comments:

      /* this code increments tmp */
      ++tmp;


When to place spaces?
   After and before comments:
      /* text */
     o
Where to put curly braces?
   functions: at the beginning of the line:

   void func(char *what, int where)
   {

   }

   Before and after '=', '==', '!='', '>=', '<='

   After ')', ','
   No space before ), so if '))', do not put a space after the first ')'.

Header:
   Put a header into each file, containing:
      - date of file being put into existence (year is enough)
      - Name and E-mail of Author
      - Description of the function

Includes:
   System includes first,
   own headers later

Indent:
   Three spaces. No tabs.

   Indent variable names, so the names begin all at the same position. Use three spaces
   to place them.
