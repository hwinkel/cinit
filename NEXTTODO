- add stat() to execute_sth, so we only execute it, if it exists
   -> do not reports errors, when on or off does not exist!
   * or perhaps use EXEC_STRICT (complain about missing),
                    EXEC_FUZZY (ignore missing)
      - could be necessary for special services like:
         - panic
         - halt
         - poweroff
         - reboot
      - also pass it to svc_start?
- Begin documentation
   * Check Makefile
   * Integrate Makefile into main Makefile
   * create manpage
   * Write a small manual
      - install
      - configure
      - boot (different OS)
- Shutdomn code:
   * begin at init, then shutdown wants/needs, ...
- check free on dep_del!
- check that the new wants and need elements are nserted the other way round
   * we go to next, elements must be put before us!
- implement do_reboot()
   * so not only booting with cinit works, but also the shutdown
- define messages
   a) human readable
   b) binary data?
- replace cinit_ipc_logon with cinit_ipc_init...
   * delay ipc code -> after start!
- Remove old code
   * remove run_svc
   * remove run_init_svc

Finally:
- test and release cinit-0.3rc1
