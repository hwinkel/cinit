   /etc/cinit/svc/getty/3spawn/on: No such file or directory
   /etc/cinit/svc/mount/rootwn/on: No such file or directory

- Cleanup build_argv.c, use openreadclose, strip_final_newline
- check execute_sth
- do not reports errors, when on or off do not exist!
- check free on dep_del!
- check that the new wants and need elements are nserted the other way round
   * we go to next, elements must be put before us!
- cleanup the sig_child handler
   * disable signals in sig_child handler
   * update status of service
   * Lookup other signalling things, too.
      - use list_search_pid

- define messages
   a) human readable
   b) binary data?
   ?
- replace cinit_ipc_logon with cinit_ipc_init...
- cleanup run_svc
   * NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE!
- implement do_reboot.c

Finally:
- test and release cinit-0.3rc1
