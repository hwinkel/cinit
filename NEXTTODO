- svc_stop()
   => stops an existing service
- svc_stop_deps() => takes care about dependencies
- svc_stop_wait()
   => calls svc_stop() and waits until the process
      is finished
         => pay attention for child handler!
         => wait for that specific PID!
         => use global lock?
- svc_stop_ipc(char *svc)
   => is called by the IPC methods
   => checks whether the service exists
   => returns the status of the service (NOT_EXISTS or
      the new one)
   => calls svc_stop_wait(), which returns
- cinit blocking while shutting down
   => not good!
   => only needed when being in ipc!
   => otherwise tree_stop() catches that again.
