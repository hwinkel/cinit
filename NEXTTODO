- insert new dependencies in tree_exec!
- write svc_execute, which forks away the new process
- cleanup the sig_child handler
   * disable signals in sig_child handler
   * update status of service
      - use list_search_pid

- continue tree_exec()
   * start first list, remove objects that have been started
   * add new dependencies (wanted_by and needed_by from the service
     being removed)
   * so tree_exec runs as long as there are elements in the list!
      - not only as long as the list is cycled!
- Fix SIG_CHILD handler!
   * Lookup other signalling things, too.
- add respawn when creating the service
- create
   * svc_on() that tries to start a service
   * svc_off() that tries to stop a service
   
- define messages
   a) human readable
   b) binary data?
   ?
- replace cinit_ipc_logon with cinit_ipc_init...
- cleanup run_svc
- implement do_reboot.c
- cleanup sig_child

Finally:
- test and release cinit-0.3rc1
